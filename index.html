According to the New York City Census, new data has shown that Brooklyn neighborhoods Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights have lost many Black residents, while gaining even more white residents in the past decade. These data points show the dramatic change in racial makeup in these communities, in what is predicted to be caused by gentrification and spikes in rent prices.

Overall, white residents are entering Bed-Stuy and Crown Heights at about the same rate that Black residents are leaving. While there isn't one main factor as to why these are the current population changes, many community members predict it has to do with factors such as rent spikes, gentrification, renovating and flipping properties, and inflation.
